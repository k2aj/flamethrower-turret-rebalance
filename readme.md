# Flamethrower Turret Rebalance

This is a Factorio mod, which attempts to nerf flamethrower turrets to a more balanced state.

## Features

- Flamethrower turrets deal 5 times less damage.
- Flamethrower turrets consume 5 times more fuel.
- Heavy/light oil damage bonuses are increased to +50%/+100% to make their use more impactful.
- Walls/gates are no longer completely immune to fire damage.

All changes are configurable through the startup settings.

This mod also supports new walls/gates/flamethrower turrets added by [AAI Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry) and [Rampant Arsenal](https://github.com/veden/RampantArsenal).
